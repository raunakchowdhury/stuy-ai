# Aim: Machine Learning
- Three types of ML:
  - supervised learning
    - recognizing dog and cat pictures (classification)
    - cannot articulate the method that you train with
  - unsupervised learning
    - figuring out distinctions that you yourself can make without supervision
  - reinforcement learning
    - provide the machine with correct labeling, but a delayed labeling
    - only gets feedback on performance at the end, make corrections
  - *diff between supervised and reinforcement learning?*

- Donald Michie
  - Compatriot of Alan Turing
  - simulated what a program could do with matchboxes (could play tic-tac-toe)
- Tic-tac-toe
  - 3 irreducible moves on move 0, which is an open board (the other 6 moves can be reflected or rotated into)
