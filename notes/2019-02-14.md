## Garbage Collection
- Memory is stored in RAM
- When a program is run, it is sucked into memory and translated into machine code
- OS' memory management unit manages memory
  - if the program exceeds the amount of memory during runtime, more memory is allocated to the process
  - makes sure that memory doesn't overlap
- Scarce resources: memory, processing power, keyboard input, mouse pointer, screen space, bandwidth
- If there is a program requesting memory but there is no memory to give, the OS crashes
