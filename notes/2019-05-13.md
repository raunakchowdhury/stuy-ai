- How to calculate srqt(2)?
  - Method 1: binary search:
    - Guess an x such that x^2 = 2; keep halving with each guess (binary search)
      - 1.5 is 1.1 in base 2
      - Gained one binary digit => 0
      - Next iteration => 1.25 = 1.01; next digit must be 1.01 < x < 1.1
      - Gaining one binary digit of accuracy for each digit
  - Method 2: f(x) = x^2 - 2
    - Finding a value such that x = 0
    - Make a guess (x0), and then find f'(x0) [which is 2x0]
      - Make a second guess (x1)
      - You get a right triangle, so f'(x0) = f(x0) / change in x
      - So therefore: x1 = 0.5(x0 + 2/x0)
      - Continue as is
    - Instead of finding one bit at a time as in binary search, it gets closer, faster
      - it doubles the # of correct bits every iteration (if u have 2 correct bits, you will have 4 in the next iteration)
