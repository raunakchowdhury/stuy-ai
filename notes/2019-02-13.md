## PriorityQueue
- MaxHeap requirements:
  - Must be a connected and binary tree
  - Every parent must be >= its children (largest # is the root)
  - Every level of the tree must be filled except the last level
  - The last level must be filled in reading order
  - When you pop off the root:
    - Move the smallest node to the top
    - Swap the temporary root with the largest root
    - Keep swapping the smallest node with the other nodes until heap property is restored ("bubble down")
- `nice` can temporarily lower the priority level of processes
