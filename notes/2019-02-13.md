## PriorityQueue
- MaxHeap requirements:
  - Must be a connected and binary tree
  - Every parent must be >= its children (largest # is the root)
  - Every level of the tree must be filled except the last level
  - The last level must be filled in reading order
  - When you pop:
    - Move the smallest node to the top
    - Swap the temporary root with the largest root
    - Keep swapping the smallest node with the other nodes until heap property is restored ("bubble down")
    - If need to swap the smallest node whose children are equal, swap with the left child
  - When you insert:
    - Add a node to the end of the tree and "bubble" the node up
    - If the inserted node is larger than the parent node, swap values
    - Keep swapping until heap property is restored
- Heaps stored as an array
  - Pos 0: Not used
  - Pos 1: Root
  - If parent node is at index n, child nodes are at indices 2n and 2n+1
  - Append new nodes at the end of the list and keep swapping
  - Pop off of the start of the list, and do conventional method
- `nice` can temporarily lower the priority level of processes
