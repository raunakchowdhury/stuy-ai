# Graph Searching
- If start, push the starting position into the frontier.
- Push node into the frontier.
- Ask if you're there yet. If yes, end.
- If not, push all neighboring nodes into frontier via a cost metric if not already in explored set.
- Push examined node into set.
- Repeat unless frontier is empty. If empty, end.

- G(N) == the cost from the start node to the current node
- H(N) == cost from current node to target node
