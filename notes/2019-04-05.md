## Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- Give you a lot of constraints and ask you to solve the problem (Scrabble is an example)
- Bunch of clues, bunch of constraints
- LSAT -- has a logic reasoning to determine intelligence â€”- much like the Turing Test
- Naming conventions: position 0 is the top left corner
  - position 80 is the bottom right corner

Thinking:
- Three functions: check square, row, and col and look for possible integers
- Check for obvious slotting in
- Then recursively backtrack by trying possibilities
